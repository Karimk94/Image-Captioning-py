AI Image Analysis Web Application

This is a powerful, self-contained web application built with Flask that performs comprehensive analysis on images. It uses a hybrid AI approach, combining two distinct deep learning models to provide rich, multi-faceted insights:
Object Detection: Identifies and tags individual objects within an image.
Image Captioning: Generates a natural, human-like sentence describing the entire scene.
The application is designed to run completely offline after an initial, one-time setup, making it ideal for local or private network use.
Features
Hybrid AI Analysis: Leverages two models for superior resultsâ€”a YOLOS model for object detection and a BLIP model for captioning.
Enriched Captions: The final caption is intelligently generated by the captioning model and then enriched with any important objects that it may have missed.
Object Tagging: Provides a clean list of all detected objects, perfect for metadata, searching, or filtering.
Visual Feedback: Draws bounding boxes directly on the image to show the location of detected objects.
100% Local & Offline: After a one-time setup, the application and all its AI models run entirely on your local machine with no need for an internet connection.
RESTful Backend: Built with Flask, providing a simple and scalable foundation for integration with other applications.
How It Works
The application uses a client-server architecture and a sophisticated AI pipeline:
Frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript): A user uploads an image file through a clean web interface.
Backend (Flask): The Python-based Flask server receives the image.
AI Pipeline (image_processor.py):
The image is first sent to the locally-stored YOLOS object detection model, which identifies objects and their locations.
Simultaneously, the image is sent to the locally-stored BLIP image captioning model, which generates a natural, descriptive sentence.
The application then compares the caption to the list of detected objects. Any important objects not mentioned in the caption are appended to it, creating a final, enriched description.
Response: The backend sends a single JSON response containing:
The processed image with bounding boxes drawn on it (as a Base64 string).
The final, enriched caption.
A list of all detected object tags.
Display: The frontend JavaScript dynamically renders the processed image, the caption, and the list of tags for the user.
Project Structure
The project is organized for clarity and maintainability.

Setup and Installation
Follow these steps to run the application on your local machine.
Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or newer
pip (Python package installer)
Installation Steps
1. Clone the Repository
Clone or download the project files to your local machine.
2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
It's highly recommended to create a virtual environment to keep project dependencies isolated.
# Navigate to the project directory
cd /path/to/image-processing-app

# Create the environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate


3. Install Dependencies
Install all the required Python libraries from the requirements.txt file.
pip install -r requirements.txt


4. Download the AI Models (One-Time Step)
This is the most important step to ensure the application runs offline. Run the download_model.py script from your terminal. This script will download both the object detection and image captioning models into local folders within your project.
This step requires an internet connection.
python download_model.py


Wait for the script to complete. It will create the local-yolos-model and local-blip-model directories.
5. Run the Application
You can now start the Flask development server. No internet connection is required from this point forward.
python app.py


6. Access the Application
Open your web browser and navigate to:
